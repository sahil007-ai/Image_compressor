This project was developed on May 20, 2024. It was my first personal project created outside the CS50P Harvard curriculum, born from a desire to apply newly acquired Python skills to a real-world problem.<br><br><b>What It Does</b><br><br>This program compresses an entire folder of images to a specified file size. It then saves the optimized images into a new, separate folder, streamlining the process of image size reduction.<br><br><b>Why It Was Created</b><br><br>I developed this tool out of a practical need. For my admission application to JD College of Engineering and Management, I had to submit numerous personally identifiable images, all of which needed to adhere to strict file size limits. This project automated that tedious task.<br><br><b>How It Was Built</b><br><br>At the time, I had just learned about the <b>Pillow library</b> in Python. I saw an opportunity to turn theory into practice by building a solution for my own problem. This project was the result of that initiative. I'll delve into the technical details below.<br><br><i>"If necessity is the mother of invention, perhaps boredom is the father of it."</i>
