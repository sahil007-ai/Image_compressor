<b>Bulk Image Compressor</b><br><br>A simple yet powerful Python script to compress all JPEG and PNG images within a folder to a specified target file size.<br><br><b>Overview</b><br><br>This script automates the process of reducing the file size of images in bulk. It iteratively adjusts the JPEG quality of each image until its size is below a defined threshold, making it perfect for preparing images for web use, email attachments, or simply saving disk space.<br><br><b>Features</b><br><br>• <b>Batch Processing:</b> Compresses all images in a specified directory.<br>• <b>Target Size Compression:</b> Aims for a specific file size (in kilobytes) for each image.<br>• <b>Handles Transparency:</b> Automatically converts PNGs with transparency (RGBA/P modes) to RGB for JPEG compatibility.<br>• <b>Iterative Quality Reduction:</b> intelligently lowers image quality in small steps to find the best balance between size and quality.<br>• <b>Error Handling:</b> Skips corrupted or problematic files without crashing.<br>• <b>Cross-Platform:</b> Runs on any system with Python and Pillow installed.<br><br><b>Requirements</b><br><br>• Python 3.x<br>• Pillow library<br><br>You can install the Pillow library using pip:<br><br>pip install Pillow<br><br><b>How to Use</b><br><br><b>Clone or download the script:</b> Save the Python code to a file (e.g., compressor.py).<br><b>Organize your images:</b> Place all the images you want to compress into a single folder.<br><b>Configure the script:</b> Open the script and modify the following variables at the bottom of the file:<br><br>Example usage<br>input_folder = 'path/to/your/images'<br>output_folder = 'path/to/save/compressed_images'<br>target_size_kb = 250 # Target size for each image in kilobytes<br><br>Replace 'path/to/your/images' with the actual path to your input folder.<br>• Replace 'path/to/save/compressed_images' with the path where you want the compressed images to be saved. The script will create this folder if it doesn't exist.<br>Adjust target_size_kb to your desired maximum file size.<br><br>4. <b>Run the script:</b> Execute the script from your terminal:<br>python compressor.py<br><br>5. <b>Check the output:</b> The compressed images will be saved in the specified output folder, and the script will print the final size of each processed image in the console.<br><br><b>How It Works</b><br><br>The script iterates through each file in the input folder. For each image, it starts with a high quality setting (85/100) and saves a JPEG version. It then checks the file size. If it's larger than the target, it reduces the quality by 5 and saves it again. This loop continues until the file size is below the target or the quality level reaches a minimum threshold (5/100), preventing excessive degradation.<br><br><b>License</b><br><br>This project is licensed under the MIT License.
